# Columbus Elixir Katas 

Each month the Columbus Elixir admins will post 2 katas

1 for folks just starting out with the langauge and 1 for folks looking for something slightly more complex

If you have ideas for katas for upcoming months, please submit them via the #kata-suggestions channel in the Columbus Elixir [slack](https://columbus-elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/)
