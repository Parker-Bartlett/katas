# September Katas 2019

## Beginner's Kata: 
via [RosettaCode][https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Guess_the_number]

> Write a program where the program chooses a number between   1   and   10.

> A player is then prompted to enter a guess. If the player guesses wrong, then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct.

> When the player has made a successful guess the computer will issue a "Well guessed!" message, and the program exits.

> A conditional loop may be used to repeat the guessing until the user is correct.


## Experienced Kata: 
via [RosettaCode][https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Guess_the_number]

> Create a four digit random number from the digits   1   to   9,   without duplication.

> The program should:

> * ask for guesses to this number
> * reject guesses that are malformed
> * print the score for the guess

> The score is computed as:
> * The player wins if the guess is the same as the randomly chosen number, and the program ends.
> * A score of one bull is accumulated for each digit in the guess that equals the corresponding digit in the randomly chosen initial number.
> * A score of one cow is accumulated for each digit in the guess that also appears in the randomly chosen number, but in the wrong position.
