## Beginner's Kata: 
Halloween Menagerie 

Create a program that generate the inventory of a spooky pet shop 
The program should: 
 * randomly generate a list of 3 creepy pets available when the user starts up the program (Have fun with options, anything from snakes to trolls is totally kosher)
 * present the list of available pets for the user to choose from and prompt them to make a selection 
 * When the user chooses their pet, have the pet make an appropriately excited exclaimation (this should be unique to each kind of pet. Think 'CAW!' for a raven or 'HSSSS' for a snake)


## Stretch Goals for Experienced Folks: 
 * add attributes to the animals that are initially generated as available inventory (things like the animals color or disposition)
 * add the ability to interact with the available pets before making your choice on which one to purchase 

Most importantly, get creative and have fun with it!
